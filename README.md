# Geneva 2019
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/tschm/geneva2019/master?filepath=work)


I have created this little project to support a talk I gave Feb 26, 2019 in a class "Analytics Strategy" by Prof. Christian Hildebrand.

In the first part I talked about Github, Docker and finally Binder.
In a second part I give some advise on internships, jobs and careers within finance.

Here's a laundry list for students:
* Embrace Github. Get an account there. Follow tschm
* Check out the Jupyter stack on Dockerhub, e.g. https://hub.docker.com/u/jupyter/
* Using https://mybinder.org/ create an interactive Notebook server
* Spread the love (for data), share your notebooks
