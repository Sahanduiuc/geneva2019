Title:

Flowing flowingly with the flowing flow
How to survive as a lazy data scientist.



I assume/hope a few of you are not interested in finance. But my talk is hopefully useful for everybody working with data and people.


Let's go back to 2007:
- I got my PhD (mathematics) in 2007. I was 12 years younger than I am today (in fact, we all are)
- It was the year the first IPhone was released! Today my IPhone 8 feels very, very old
- George W. Bush was president. Back then we all assumed there is no chance there will ever be a worse president than Bush 
- And there was no Github, no Docker...
- The idea of sharing your work with the world was insane... 


Sharing meant printing code fragments into a paper. 
---------------------------------------------------


- Who is on Github? I am. Please follow me: tschm

- Have we heard of Docker?

- Who is maintaining a private server, e.g. an AWS server

- What's the result of all your efforts? Do you share code?






- Sending e-Mails with lengthy attachments?

But let's assume we have done the first step and have created a repository (on Github). We cloned it on our local machine.
We added some data, we added a little script. 

Have you heard of dependency hell? 

Assume you send some code to Christian. Do you think Christian would be happy to debug your code in case it's not running on his machine?
Why is it not running?
